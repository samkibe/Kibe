  <h1>It's now about two months to the end of year 2023, 
    infact not about, but two, and guys we have talked about Christ this whole year, 
    haven't we? Is it because we were any special? 
    No, it's just because Christ deserves all honor imaginable!
    Yes I know we have not been good as he would have expected us to be, 
    mind you probably we were worse every minute, but one special thing about Christ, 
    He intercedes for us, probably tells God, "leave them father, they will be alright." 
    No one can be this wonderful, no one ever, but Christ! God incarnation ‚úäüèø</h1>

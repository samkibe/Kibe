  <p><b>These are usually my assumptions, 
    as a logical defense to anyone who asks me to account for the hope that is in me, 
    in Christ my Lord and Savior.
    Now, speaking of age, when we get to +25 years and above,
     it's time to get right with God, not that we have been allowed to distance ourselves since birth, 
     what I mean is if we were actually born and raised with the fear of God, 
     but rebelled somewhere in-between stupidity and immaturity(adolescence) 
     we now can't afford to extend past this humble age, relax, 
     I have not even made my point yet, that's just an introduction üòÇ. ‚úäüèø</b></p>

  <p><b>Devil lied to us when we used the narrative, 
    everyone make mistakes, but what mistakes devil?  
    it's usually mistakes to make God angry right? And it's usually for his gain. 
    See, he is just a pathetic liar.
    Back to my point, at certain age it's commendable to actually be a sinner under the mercies and grace of God, 
    yeah I can see you face right now, sinner?? Yes, because trust me, you waking up with an attitude is sin enough to God, 
    because he is infinitely holy, 
    so don't you sit back and pretend to wonder what sin I'm talking about. Rage is one.!</b></p>

  <p><b>Instead of thanking him for waking us safe, 
    we wake up angry because the alarm sounded supposedly earlier than we would expect. 
    Mind you the alarm woke us exactly how we programmed it to wake us.

    Back to my point again, you can't be a grown up dude, 
    and you still can't figure out how far God has brought you yet, 
    or you think that was you? See, if you think it was you, you are kinda sick, 
    because start with you waking up, that was not you, 
    you went into slumber and God would have decided not to wake you up, 
    considering your attitude against him during the day. Right?.</b></p>

  <p><b>Stay blessed!</b></p>

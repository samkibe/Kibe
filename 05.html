  <p><b>I was seated in a mat coming to work this evening, 
    browsing through social media and I caught up with the number of accidents that happened 
    the just ended Christmas Holiday, 
    and it crashed my soul pretty bad, let me break it to you, I teared up involuntarily, 
    I am very sure someone saw me cry a river.. 
    Ooh boy, either I'm getting old or older, because the crying is becoming too much, 
    i try to stay in brokeness because it reminds me of God's grace in my life, 
    and how good he has been to me, irregardless of my attitude towards him sometimes</b></p>

    <p><b>I'm very sure you want me to explain my crying thing, well, 
      when i think of the work Christ has accomplished in me, i just tear up good, 
      you can't believe what a wonderful job he has done so far to mould me to the gentleman I'm becoming, 
      this can never go untold.. not in material context neither is in immaterial, 
      but still to my definition can be both material and immaterial in godly terms and sense. 🙏🏿🤞🏿✊🏿 Mind my English!!</b></p>

  <p><b>The feeling I get when i think about the things of God is mutually involuntary and 
    the work of his grace, and I guess this is as a result of anyone who takes their time to 
    bend that knee and mention me in their prayers as I do to all y'all. 
    Never stop, don't stop, Pray and even more, God has a wonderful plan for all of Us.

    Texts says in Jeremiah 29:11  "For I know the plans I have for you," 
    declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." 
     I love the hope and a future part!! ✊🏿!</b></p>


  <p><b>In conclusion, not anyone of us who made it this far, 
    had done anything special to deserve his mercies and grace, but he gave it anyway. 
    This God who does what he pleases, it pleased him to allow us see yesterday,
     today and possibly tomorrow and the future as he intends, for his own glory!

    Also whatever happened on the roads stands accounted for, 
    by his will and purposes through his divine Providence. 
    Father, find it in your heart to forgive us, we repent of our sins, in Jesus name! Amen 🙏🏿!</b></p> 
  <p><b>Stay humble and be blessed!</b></p>

  <p><b>I was seated in a mat coming to work this evening, 
    browsing through social media and I caught up with the number of accidents that happened the just ended Christmas Holiday, 
    and it crashed my soul pretty bad, let me break it to you, I teared up involuntarily, 
    I am very sure someone saw me cry a river.. 
    Ooh boy, either I'm getting old or older, because the crying is becoming too much, 
    i try to stay in brokeness because it reminds me of God's grace in my life, 
    and how good he has been to me, irregardless of my attitude towards him sometimes</b></p>

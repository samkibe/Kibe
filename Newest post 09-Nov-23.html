    We make plans, big ones supposedly, but 'que sera sera,' 
    whatever will be will be, song writer sang. 
    And I would want to agree with them. Our future second or minute is entirely in the hands of God. 
    Took me a long time to see it, but there is an order to things, a plan, 
    and it has never been our plans, but God's. 
    And everything that happens is part of it, 
    even the simplest aspect of our existence in struggle or better is entirely God's plan. 
    That's my definition of God's divine Providence, for his own purpose and will!! ✊🏿🤞🏿💪

  <p><b>One time you were in your mothers womb, 
    then you were born, you couldn't hold you head up, 
    you couldn't even sit up straight, 
    everytime you would sit you could just drop like a rock head first, 
    you couldn't even take yourself to the bathroom, 
    you went straight into your pants, 
    and the only thing you were good at was drooling all over the place...,
    but now you are all grown up to challenge and disown a supernatural being that was there even 
    before you were a seed in your mothers womb? ooh blimey!!</b></p>

  <p><b>God is sovereign, has been sovereign even before our parents, 
    parents, parents existed, and will remain sovereign long after we are gone, 
    our kids and there kids, until the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

    So, honestly it doesn't matter the attitude we have about his sovereignty, 
    the fact remains and it's beyond doubt, that, his plan and purpose will come to pass, 
    and this is whether we like it or not. 
    Our opinion about how the world is set up or should have been set up,
     better or worse will never change his will! On his people or otherwise..</b></p>

  <p><b>Stay humble and be blessed!</b></p>
